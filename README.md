Milestone 2 Descriptive Stats and Milestone 3 Beyond Descriptive Stats
========
Always Read The README

If you are one of the lucky souls who were chosen to peer review this work, relax, you don't have to look at each file. They come in sets of 3. There is a .png
image which is a graphical representation of the hierarchial aboveground biomasss loss over the years 2001 - 2018 for each province in Indonesia. The big circles
represent large loss for a year, small circles small loss. If you are interested, and decide to look at a couple you will notice a trend, peaking mid century and 
starting to decline.

The other 2 files have .html tags; one is a single regression analysis of the aboveground biomass loss in millions of gallons against years, the other is a multiple regression analysis of the aboveground_biomass_loss_Mg, aboveground_co2_emissions, and treecover_loss_ha against years.

So look at a set or 2 of 3, more if something catches your eye. Don't buy products with palm oil

As of Milestone 3 there are 33 graphic files and 15 single regression and 15 multiple regression files.
